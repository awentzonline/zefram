Boldly seek out new warp field metrics.

This package was inspired in part by [WarpFactory](https://github.com/NerdsWithAttitudes/WarpFactory).
Some code from that has been translated to python.
You should read the [paper associated with Warp Factory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03095) if you want to learn some warp theory.
