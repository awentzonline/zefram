Boldly seek out new warp metrics.

This package was inspired in part by [WarpFactory](https://github.com/NerdsWithAttitudes/WarpFactory) and its
associated [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03095). That and a [more recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02709) by the same authors are good reads if you want to learn more about contemporary warp drive theory.
